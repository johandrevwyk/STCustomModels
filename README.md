# SharpTimer Custom Models

This plugin allows you to add and give access to custom models for VIP users using SharpTimer (there is also an option to make it public)

# Requirements

[CounterStrikeSharp](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp)\
[SharpTimer](https://github.com/DEAFPS/SharpTimer)\
[CS2Fixes (dual mount addon)](https://github.com/Source2ZE/CS2Fixes)\
[ResourcePrecacher](https://github.com/KillStr3aK/ResourcePrecacher)


You need to load the models in ResourcePrecacher and copy them to server directory (you are on your own)

Be sure to edit **config.json** and enter database details + models

# Usage
